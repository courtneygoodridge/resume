### PhD student in Experimental Psychology

Education {data-icon=graduation-cap data-concise=true}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### University of Leeds

PhD, Experimental Psychology

Leeds, UK

Expected 2021 - 2018

Thesis: "Understanding Human Control of Skilled Actions." 

A collaborative project between the School of Psychology and Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds.

The overall aim is to generate a better understanding of driver sensorimotor initiation whilst operating manual and autonomous vehicles which will feed-forward into real-world applications to inform research, design and policy within the automotive industry.

### University of Birmingham

MSc, Brain Imaging and Cognitive Neuroscience

Birmingham, UK

2018 - 2017

Graduated in December 2018 with Distinction.

Modules include: Research Project (85%) Applications of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Neuroscience (77%), Fundamentals in Brain Imaging Methods (84%), Design and Analysis (70%)

Thesis: "Is Alpha Oscillatory Power Responsible for Cross-Modal Inhibition During Simultaneous Multi-Sensory Processing?"

This masters focused my understanding on brain imaging techniques and how they are used to understand human behaviour. I designed, implemented and analysed data utilising functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).

This masters developed my ability to conduct literature reviews and think critically about how these experimental paradigms are analysed, critiqued, and how they influence and inform wider society.

### Sheffield Hallam University 

BSc, Psychology

Sheffield, UK

2017 - 2014

Graduated in November 2017 with 1st Class Honours.

Thesis: "An Eye Tracking Study Investigating the Differences in Visual Attention Given to Artificial and Natural Threats."

Modules include: Psychological Research in Action (80%), Research Methods and Statistics (79%, 84%), Qualitative Research Methods (79%), Quantitative Research Methods (80%), Clinical Psychology (80%), Research Project (76%).

During my undergraduate training, I established a key focus on quantitative and qualitative research methods and design, alongside how to apply this within academic and non-academic environments.

### Friesland School and Sixth Form

GCSES/ A levels

Nottingham, UK

2014 - 2007

A Levels: Psychology (A*) Business (B) General Studies (C)

AS Levels: Sociology (A) (Chemistry (D)

GCSE's: 12 B-C GCSEâ€™s including English and Maths


Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Undergraduate seminar leader

University of Leeds

Leeds, UK

present - 2018

- Teaching assistant for second year computer lab sessions | *Skills: statistical inference and modelling*
- Seminar leader for first year undergraduate research skills and statistics module | *Skills: research design, scientific communication, statistical data analysis* 

Teaching first and second year psychology students has allowed me to enhance my research skills by improving my overall knowledge base surrounding an area in order to teach this to others. This also demonstrates how I am able to confidently present complex ideas independently. 

### Masters research thesis

University of Birmingham

Birmingham, UK

2018 - 2017

- EEG signal processing | *Skills: statistical analysis of complex data structures*
- Manuscript writing | *Skills: scientific written communication, synthesis of complex data into applied knowledge*

This research project experimentally investigated multi-sensory processing using EEG. This improved my ability to design simple paradigms to answer complex research questions alongside processing and analysing complex data. 

It further allowed me to present complicated findings, both in written form and visually, that the lay person could interpret and understand. This manuscript was written up for target journal submission in NeuroImage and Human Brain Mapping.

### Masters research placement

University of Birmingham

Birmingham, UK

2018 - 2017

- Functional MRI data analysis | *Skills: statistical analysis of complex data structures*
- Manuscript writing | *Skills: scientific written communication, synthesis of complex data into applied knowledge*

This placement investigated the functional brain differences between clinical and healthy control populations using fMRI. Determining differences would allow for recommendations for behavioural and cognitive therapies that could improve the wellbeing of clinical samples. 

This work was presented at the University of Birmingham School Postgraduate Research Event 2018 and later submitted as a conference abstract to the Society of Biological Psychiatry 2019.

### Research assistant

Sheffield Hallam University

Sheffield, UK


2017 - 2016

- Manuscript writing | *Skills: scientific written communication, synthesis of complex data into applied knowledge*
- Informing social policy | *Skills: conducting research that influences social policy*

This study utilised EEG to investigate attentional bias neural signatures in smokers and e-cigarette users. This research focused on the claim that e-cigarette usage aids smoking cessation. The research investigated whether there was neural evidence for this claim by comparing cigarette/e-cigarette users attentional biases to smoking/non-smoking paraphernalia. Preliminary results indicated that e-cigarettes users had similar attentional biases to smoking stimuli as ordinary cigarette users (versus control stimuli). 

### Qualitative research project

Sheffield Hallam University

Sheffield, UK

2016 - 2015

- Qualitative design | *Skills: designing and conducting interviews*
- Qualitative analysis | *Skills: understanding qualitative data through thematic analysis frameworks*

This qualitative research project investigated the themes surrounding UK-bound immigration across differing media platforms. This was particularly enlightening due to the ongoing Brexit debate which was, in part, fuelled by views on immigration. This unique project gave me an insight into how to handle and analyse qualitative data, as well as how to conduct interviews that answer specific research questions within a broad scope. 

Poster presentations {data-icon=chalkboard-teacher}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Conference

University of Leeds

Nantes, France

2019

In October 2019 I was invited to present the findings of my first PhD experiment to world leading academics and people in industry. This poster presentation was a great opportunity for me to pitch my findings to those working in applied fields. I received good feedback on the applicability of my findings to the automotive industry. 

### University of Birmingham Postgraduate Research Event

University of Birmingham

Birmingham, UK

2018

In May 2018 I presented the findings of my research placement at the Postgraduate School Research Event. Professionals from both academic and medical backgrounds gave me the unique opportunity to present my work to an audience from a variety of fields. This was vital experience for future presentations where work being presented is applicable to a variety of different people.
